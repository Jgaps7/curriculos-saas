# Currículos SaaS – AI Resume Analysis Platform

## Overview
Currículos SaaS is a Python-based SaaS application designed to analyze resumes using artificial intelligence and data processing techniques.  
The project focuses on automating the extraction of relevant information from resumes, transforming unstructured documents into structured data that can support hiring, screening, and decision-making processes.

This project simulates a real-world SaaS workflow, combining AI-driven analysis with scalable backend logic.

## About the Author
Developed by **Julio Alencar**, Technology & Automation Specialist focused on building scalable digital systems through process automation, system integrations, data analysis, and applied artificial intelligence.

Open to remote and international opportunities.

## Current Architecture Limitation

The current deployment uses Supabase (free tier) as the database layer.
Due to free-tier limitations, some SaaS features are restricted.

This project was intentionally designed to be database-agnostic and ready
for migration to a dedicated PostgreSQL instance for production use.
